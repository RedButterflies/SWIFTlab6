# SWIFTlab6
Program written by me for the 6th SWIFT class lab



English translation of the task given

Task 6.2.
Command 1. Write a console program that will define an array of integer elements
about default values. The size of this array should be set to 10.
Command 2. Add the loaded integer to the zero element of the array.
Command 3. Add the loaded integer on the table index that will remain
randomly generated.
Command 4. Display the elements of the received arrays.


Task 6.3.
Command 1. Write a console program that will read the number of items from the user
array and its integer elements, and then will check and display whether the loaded integer:
is the first element of the array,
is the last element of the array.
You need to check whether the loaded data are integers and whether the loaded number of array elements is positive.


Task 6.4.
Command 1. Write a console program that will read the number of array elements and integer elements into two arrays from the user. The program should check whether they contain identical elements or whether they are different.
You need to check whether the loaded data are integers and whether the loaded number of array elements is positive.

Task 6.5.
Command 1. Write a console program that will read the number of elements of an array and its floating-point elements from the user, and then display the smallest and largest number. The items can be sorted first.

Task 6.6.
Command 1. Write a console program that will read the number of elements of an array and its integer elements from the user, and then display the longest ascending substring. If such a substring does not exist, display appropriate information.

Task 6.7.
Command 1. Write a console program that will define a two-dimensional array, assign values to it, and then display it as a matrix. A code example is provided
in Listing 6.20.
let mac: [[Int]] = [[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60]]
for i in 0 ..< mac.count {
for j in 0 ..< mac[i].count{
print("\(mac[i][j])", terminator:" ")
}
print()
}
Task 6.8.
Command 1. Write a console program that will read the number of rows and columns of a matrix and its integer elements from the user.
Command 2. Check which row contains the elements with the highest sum. If there are more than one such row, display the first one. You need to display the row number and the sum of the items in that row.
